# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
    - It was overwhelming to attempt these challenges and a little deflating.  But I used the study hall for the first time and learned what a world of difference it makes to work with a group instead of solo.  I've learned I enjoy working with a team even if we don't know what we're doing we'll learn better together.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
    - I remember to take 5 min breaks but usually spend that time doing breathing exercises then right back work. This has not been working. I need to edit my calendar and require some down time or walks for 30mins to get out of my head and see if that works.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
    - I need to review the lessons with people from the class and talk out loud to people for it to stick in my head and make sense. I cannot be embarressed about asking questions! Probably someone also has the same question or it might help another class mate who needs work on explaining things out loud.
